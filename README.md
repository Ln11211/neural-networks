## Neural-Networks
A collection of Neural networks and NN models trained by me while I learn deep learning :)

# 1)Custom Multiclass classifier

This interactive notebook is a quick wakthrough of the ML workflow of loading up an image dataset and performing a multiclass classification. The dataset is the famous CIFAR_10 dataset having 10 classes. The model that I built is a simple custom model with couple of Convolution blocks and MaxPooling layers with a FC dense layer as the classifier head. THe dataset comes preprocessed from the TF Hub datasets but this is a good introduction notebook for beginners.

# 2)Garment recognition model

Another multiclass classifier trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset with a deeper Neural network and more convolution blocks with an aim to understand if the depth of a model increases the accuracy of the classifier. This is a direct improvement over the Cifar model with evidently deeper architecture and more parameters.

# 3) Indian Age recognition model

 A Deep computer vision model with the ability to identify the age of an Indian and classify them into one among the three age groups- Young, Old, Middle.
The dataset I used for this Project is The Indian Movie Face database (IMFDB) by Shankar setty et-al.[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6776225]
